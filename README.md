## Console Log:
Console log prints a string. Syntax:
````javascript
console.log("hiya friend!");
````

## Data Types
### Numbers 
Any positive or negetive integer and decimals. We can do on the fly arithmatic calculations with them on the browser. </br>
**Comparing Numbers:** Comaparing opeartions can be done on numbers. The result of the comparison will returned in boolean (true or false).</br>

### Strings
We have to use the same quote (' ' or " ") for the String datatype in JS. Strings won't work without quotes. </br>

### String Concat
Strings can be concatenated with other strings with the **+** operator. Strings can be concatanated with arithmaic operations of numbers as well. For example: </br>

### String Comparisons
String comparisons are case sensetive. 
````javascript "Yes" == "yes" 
````The code above will return _false_ in the console.


### String Index
String indexing starts from **0**. Spaces are valid characters and take up indexes in strings.

## Variables
For JS variables we use the **var** keyword. It can be used for any kind of data type. For example: </br>
````javascript
var afterTax = 500.00; //use camelCase for varibale names (convention) </br>
var name = "zoe";
````
